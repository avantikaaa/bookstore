# Dependencies:
 - Make
 - g++ compiler
# How to run:
 - run the command "make" to generate the executable "main"
 - use the command "./main" to begin the execution of the program.
 - While the program is running, there is sufficient information given while taking the input. Note that there is error handling done for invalid inputs of the same type. But if a different type is given as input, like string instead of int(expected), then the program will exit.
